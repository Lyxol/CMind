# CMind
[C++]

Made by LyxolDev.

Works currently only on Linux.

The files "Socket.h" & "Socket.cpp" were not made by me.

This was a project i've made for my studies.

The aim was to create an online version of the card game "The Mind" with one or multiple different clients as players, and a server. 

## WARNING : This project does not work well right now
List of things to correct :
 - Modify the way clients join the server
 - Rework how cards are exchange between the server and the clients

Things I would like to add :
 - A client with an interface , made with Java
 - An Android client
